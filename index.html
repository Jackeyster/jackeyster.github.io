        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my webpage. I am an IT Major at the University of North Florida. <br> 
            Some interesting facts about me would include that I used to play Baseball in High School. I was a shortstop for Fletcher High School when we won the regional championship. 
            <br>One of my goals for the Summer is to learn to play the piano. I hope to see improvement by the Fall Semester.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My current educational goal is to learn and grow in the field of computing. I'm hoping to graduate this Fall Semester and walk away better than I was when I first enrolled at UNF.</p>
        <p>The following are all the diplomas, degrees, and/or certificates I have earned or am working towards:</p>
